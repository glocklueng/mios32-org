MIDIbox KB V1.005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o USB device settings have been changed.
     IMPORTANT: please install MIOS32 Bootloader V1.010 before uploading
     the application! Otherwise code upload via USB won't work anymore!
     (Backup: upload via MIDI IN1/OUT1)

   o 4 USB ports are enabled now.
     Note: if your operating system still displays only a single MIDI port for USB,
     then unplug the USB cable and remove the USB MIDI driver in your system setup,
     so that the driver be installed again once the core module has been re-connected.
     E.g. under MacOS this can be done with the Audio-MIDI Setup application
     (search for "Audio" in Spotlight)

   o support for GM5 driver under Windows.
     - upload the application with MIOS Studio
     - close MIOS Studio
     - install the GM5 driver which can be downloaded from http://www.ucapps.de/mios32_download.html
     - start MIOS Studio -> 4 "GM5" USB ports should be visible
