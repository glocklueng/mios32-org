MIDIO128 V3.011pre4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o USB device settings have been changed.
     IMPORTANT: please install MIOS32 Bootloader V1.009 before uploading
     the application! Otherwise code upload via USB won't work anymore!
     (Backup: upload via MIDI IN1/OUT1)

   o 4 USB ports are enabled now.
     Note: if your operating system still displays only a single MIDI port for USB,
     then unplug the USB cable and remove the USB MIDI driver in your system setup,
     so that the driver be installed again once the core module has been re-connected.
     E.g. under MacOS this can be done with the Audio-MIDI Setup application
     (search for "Audio" in Spotlight)

   o 4 MIDI IN/OUT ports are enabled now.
     Pin mapping for LPC17 (see also http://www.ucapps.de/mbhp/mbhp_core_lpc17_midi3_midi4_extension.pdf):
     - MIDI OUT3 is available at J5B.A7
     - MIDI IN3 is available at J5B.A6
     - MIDI OUT4 is available at J4B.SD
     - MIDI IN4 is available at J4B.SC

     since MIDI IN3/OUT3 allocate analog input pins, AIN Pin #6 and #7 is
     not available anymore!

   o support for MIOS Filebrowser, which will be part of MIOS Studio 2.4

   o fixed FFwd/FRwd function

   o song not set back to 1.1 if song position was changed while 
     sequencer was paused


MIDIO128 V3.011pre3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o application doesn't hang-up anymore if recording is enabled while

   o first MIDI song already selected after boot

   o play modes: aside from All and Single, we've now also a "Loop" mode
     which repeats the selected song

   o a fourth clock mode has been added: "Lock". It prevents tempo changes
     from the MIDI file. The BPM generator is always in master mode.

   o the "MIDI" page has been renamed to ".MID"

   o if you scroll the .MID page to the right side, you will find configuration
     options for MIDI ports assigned to the Rec/Play/Clock IN and Clock OUT functions

   o all new options can now be stored/restored into/from .MIO files


MIDIO128 V3.011pre2

   o BPM mode can be switched between Auto/Master/Slave by pressing
     shift button + soft button 2

   o record event monitor: display input port name instead of output port name

   o record event monitor: display "DIN" instead of "Def"(ault) when DIN
     generated events are recorded

   o only in this pre2 release: whenever the next/previous file is selected,
     the searched files are listed in the MIOS terminal

   o MIDI router config: renamed SrcP to DstP


MIDIO128 V3.011pre1

MIDIO128 V3.007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o corrected SysEx output for LPC17


MIDIO128 V3.006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for two MBHP_AINSER64 modules: up to 128 analog pins can be scanned!

   o improved MIDI OUT throughput


MIDIO128 V3.005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o fixed "out of memory" issue in MIDI player


MIDIO128 V3.004
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o MIDI router supports 16 nodes now! (previously only 8)

   o added new MIOS terminal commands:
     - display network informations, modify network and OSC settings
     - display MIDI router informations, modify MIDI router settings


MIDIO128 V3.003
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o MSD mode (SD Card Reader) can now also be enabled with the "msd" command
     in MIOS Terminal


MIDIO128 V3.002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o adaptions for new MIOS32 Bootloader V1.005
     You can safely enable the "fastboot" option of the bootloader, so that
     the application starts immediately after power-on


MIDIO128 V3.001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o integrated MSD (Mass Storage Device) driver, so that SD Card can be accessed
     from a computer via USB (like from a SD Card Reader).

     Press SHIFT and hold MSD (3rd soft button) for two seconds to enable the driver.
     Your computer should automatically mount the SD Card.
     USB MIDI won't be available anymore.

     After disk operations, don't forget to unmount the SD Card on your computer
     first, thereafter disable MSD in the SHIFT menu.
     Thereafter USB-MIDI will be available again.

   o added integrated MIDI monitor for USB/MIDI/OSC ports (-> "Mon." page)

   o support for up to 8 analog inputs which are available at J5A and J5B
     of the MBHP_CORE_LPC17 module.

     Pins are disabled by default - once a MIDI port (such as USB1, OUT1
     or OSC1) has been assigned to the pin in the AIN page, or in an AIN entry
     of the .MIO file, the pin will send MIDI events on pot position changes.


MIDIO128 V3.000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o initial version




Wishlist

- Whilst playing some of the MIDI files I thought it might be nice 
if the tempo/playback speed could be varied
