Downloading Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the repository with:
   svn co svn://svnmios.midibox.org/mios32

If you have write access to the midibox.org SVN server, use:
   svn co svn+ssh://svn@midibox.org/mios32


Synching Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just type "svn update" in the root directory of the repository


Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before compiling code, set the MIOS32 environment variables:

Unix (we assume, that the repository has been dowloaded into ~/svn)
  export MIOS32_PATH=~/svn/mios32/trunk
  export MIOS32_BIN_PATH=$MIOS32_PATH/bin

DOS: (we assume, that the repository has been downloaded to D:\)
  set MIOS32_PATH=D:\mios32\trunk
  set MIOS32_BIN_PATH=D:\mios32\trunk\bin


Installing Toolchain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows
=======

STM32 Primer: install the toolchain which comes with the CD (Ride7)

STR9 comStick: install WinARM
-> http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/arm_projects/#winarm


MacOS
=====

STM32 Primer
------------

Excellent guide can be found under
-> http://www.paintyourdragon.com/uc/osxstm32/index.html
Note, that the installation of FatFryer is not required, as CircleOS
is not used. 
For the MIOS32 platform, a Bootloader for MacOS/Linux is not available
yet, therefore the upload of a .hex file has do be done from a Windows
PC with the cortex_pgm tool, which comes with the Ride7 IDE
Command:
   cortex_pgm.exe TSTM32F103RBT6 E B PRTOSDemo.hex S


STR9 comStick
-------------

Precompiled binaries for arm-elf-gcc, which are based on WinARM, are
available here:
-> http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/ARM_GCC_toolchain_for_Linux_and_Mac_OS_X

Expert knowledge is required to recompile newer gcc sources due to various
issues with MacOS gcc installation, see also:
-> http://gmplib.org/macos.html

.bin file (memory image format like .hex) can be downloaded with openOCD:
http://openocd.berlios.de/web/
(scripts available on request, ask TK)


Linux
=====

STM32 Primer
------------

gcc sources can be downloaded from:
-> http://www.paintyourdragon.com/uc/osxstm32/index.html
and simply recompiled for your Linux installation

Download of .hex files: same issue as for MacOS

NOTE for Ubuntu users: you may have to install:
-buil-essential
-texinfo
-flex
-bison
If the compiler complains because can' t find "stdio_ext.h" try:
    sudo chmod 644 /usr/include/stdio_ext.h
and
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/usr/include"
to be sure that the C compiler is looking for headers in the right place.

Precompiled binaries for arm-elf-gcc, which are based on WinARM, are
available here:
-> http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/ARM_GCC_toolchain_for_Linux_and_Mac_OS_X

But is should also be possible to install a newer version.
