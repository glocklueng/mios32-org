This application checks the handling of a Button/LED matrix driven by the blm_x
module. The first push on a button resets the LED at this button to 0 (off). Each
subsequent push on the same button switches to the next color. If all possible
color-combinations are walked through, the LED's go all to 0 (off) again.
The color (mix of all available LED's at one matrix point) is set by a 32bit
integer, each bit represents a LED. Each button push just increments this value
until the number of configured colors is reached, and wraps back to 0.

Note that you could theoretically control up to 32 LED's each matrix-point! 
The most usual application will be to drive just two- or three-color-LED's.
