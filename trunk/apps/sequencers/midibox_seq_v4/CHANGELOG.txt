MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o implemented "Sessions" concept. Now you can change between different setups
     stored on a single SD Card

   o Sessions can be opened/saved/created in the main menu (press EXIT button)

   o your old session isn't lost, it's just at the wrong place.
     To take over this session:
       - enter MSD mode (UTILITY->DISK)
       - create a backup of all *.V4 files on your PC (recommented for Beta17!!!)
       - create a /SESSIONS directory if it doesn't exist yet
       - create a session subdirectory (8 characters maximum)
       - copy following files:
         MBSEQ_B1.V4, MBSEQ_B2.V4, MBSEQ_B3.V4, MBSEQ_B4.V4, 
         MBSEQ_S.V4, MBSEQ_G.V4, MBSEQ_C.V4
       - create a second session subdirectory
       - copy following files:
         MBSEQ_B5.V4, MBSEQ_B6.V4, MBSEQ_B7.V4, MBSEQ_B8.V4, 
         MBSEQ_S.V4, MBSEQ_G.V4, MBSEQ_C.V4
       - rename these files to MBSEQ_B1.V4 to MBSEQ_B4.V4
       - don't copy MBSEQ_HW.V4 (always read from root directory)
       - remove the copied *.V4 files from root directory, or move
         them to another directory for backup
       - unmount the SD Card on your computer
       - wait until MSD mode is disabled!
       - press EXIT, thereafter OPEN the session by pressing GP button 9


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o MIDI->Section Control: Octaves which are not taken for section selection
    can now be optionally forwarded to a configurable MIDI port.
    This saves you from adding a keyboard splitter to your MIDI keyboard, if
    you want to play a MIDI instrument from an unused keyboard zone.

  o fixed bug in live recording function (notelength sometimes not recorded correctly)

  o MIOS terminal functions have been added. Just enter "help" in the terminal
    which has been integrated into MIOS Studio 2

  o copy function now works correctly together with the section concept

  o Follow function now available as dedicated button and with key combination MENU+EXIT

  o the Follow Song option under UTILITY->Options has been removed. The selected
    follow mode won't be stored on SD Card anymore. Follow is deactivated after
    power-on and has to be manually enabled (e.g. by pressing MENU+EXIT)


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o Track sections which should be played can now be selected via MIDI
    Keyboard as demonstrated in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_RQL24j8no

    Each group (G1/2/3/4) has a separate selection zone on the keyboard.
    Key C..B select section 1..12, the first key of the octave (C) plays
    the first section as usual, it has the same effect as if this feature
    is disabled.

    The width of a section depends on the track length.

    E.g., if the track length is set to 32, and if it consists of 256 steps,
    8 sections are available which can be selected with Key C/C#/D/D#/E/F#/F/F#/G


    It is recommented to activate the "Follow" function under UTILITY->OPTIONS
    when using this feature, so that the edit display gets automatically updated
    whenever the section is changed.

  o the MIDI configuration page has been overworked to handle the new parameters.
    Track sections can be selected from a dedicated MIDI Port and Channel.
    The keyboard zone assigned to the group can be changed, so that it's possible
    to merge groups (e.g. all 4 groups controlled from a single octave).

  o an individual section can be selected for each track in the StepView.
    Press & Hold StepView + SELECT button, then press the GP button of the
    appr. section.
    This feature is also nice for editing large tracks!

  o implemented CC#123 (All Notes Off) - it empties the note stacks if
    value 0 is received. Values > 0 will be ignored

  o bugfix for ALL button as reported by Gridracer
    

TODO for MBSEQ V4.0beta16
  o TODO: sections can also be selected with the BLM4x16 on the same way like
    with a keyboard. The currently active section is displayed by the LEDs.

  o TODO: sections can also be selected with the BLM16x16. In this case, we
    have individual selections for all 16 tracks.



MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o prepared support for MBHP_BLM_SCALAR.
    The MIDI port can be configured in MIDI menu (MIDI->Misc.)

  o various minor bugfixes


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta13
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o pulsewidth of DIN Sync clock now definable in MBSEQ_HW.V4 file
    (DIN_SYNC_CLK_PULSEWIDTH parameter)

  o Parameter/Trigger Layer selection can now be quickly incremented/decremented
    by pressing&holding Layer C button, and incrementing with Layer A button,
    resp. decrementing with Layer B button.

  o various minor bugfixes


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o Tracks can now be stored into/loaded from preset files on SD Card.
    This features opens some new possibilities:
    - you can store your favourite track configurations, melody lines, 
      drum loops, etc. in separate files to recall them later
    - you can prepare drum maps for different instruments
    - you can prepare CC setups for different instruments
    - you can share the files (which are stored in the preset/ directory)
      with other users
    - you can view and edit the files with a common text editor.

    The preset functions are available in the MENU->EVENT page

    You've to create a "presets" directory in the root directory of 
    your SD Card before using this feature (the DOSFS driver used 
    by MBSEQ doesn't support "mkdir")


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o paste function now only changes track partitioning if the track mode of
    target track is different. Other settings (number of parameter/trigger
    layers, number of parameter/trigger steps, number of instruments) won't
    be changed if track mode is equal.

  o bugfix for BLM_BUTTONS_NO_UI option


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o Tracks/Patterns/Songs can now be exported to a MIDI file.
    The appr. menu function is available under UTILITY->DISK->Export

  o a simple MIDI In/Out monitor page has been added.
    The page can be entered via MENU+MIDI->MIDI Monitor (GP 16 button).

    MIDI Clock and Active Sense events are filtered by default. The
    filter option can be changed by pressing SELECT in the MIDI Monitor page.

  o separated "pattern length" from "measure length" parameter in UTILITY->OPT menu.
    Pattern length is used for synchronized pattern changes, and measure
    length for the Synch-to-Measure function.

    The left encoder below the item allows to select 16 step wise, the right
    encoder and datawheel stepwise.

  o Paste/Clr behaviour option in UTILITY->OPT menu implemented now

  o HWCFG file option "BLM_BUTTONS_NO_UI" implemented now



MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o If a sequence is already running, the MIDI file player doesn't cause a restart
    anymore. Instead in automatically synchs to the next 16 step based measure.

  o Track Event page: to trigger the Init function, GP16 has to be pressed for
    2 seconds (a message will be displayed to inform about this)

  o fixed various minor bugs


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o now your MIDIbox SEQ can play MIDI files, either exclusively or in parallel to
    the 16 sequencer tracks.

    MIDI files have to be copied into the /midi directory of your SD Card.

    To select a MIDI file, go to the UTILITY->DISK->PLAY page, and select
    the desired modes (Exclusive/Parallel and Loop on/off)

  o MIDI file import and export prepared in UI, but not implemented yet!

  o MIDI port used to send a SysEx dump now selectable in file list browser

  o fixed various minor bugs


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o a new label editor allows to enter track and pattern names so fast and easy
    like typing a SMS on a mobile phone. Use the first 10 GP buttons or encoders
    to cycle the characters (like on a telephone keypad), and the remaining
    buttons/encoders to select a character directly, move the cursor, delete/insert
    characters, selecting a preset (with the encoder) and to exit the editor.

  o implemented synchronous pattern change after x steps (x=1..256)
    This function has to be enabled in the UTILITY->OPT page.

  o implemented Follow Song mode. It has to be enabled in UTILITY->OPT menu.

  o a warning message will be print if Synch-to-Measure is enabled, and a 
    track length greater than steps per measure is selected.

  o CC number selected in Track Event and LFO Configuration page now has to be
    confirmed with GP button below the appr. item.
    A warning message will pop up to notify about this unusual data entry method.
    In addition, the value will be marked with '!' so long it doesn't match with
    currently active value.

  o fixed various minor bugs


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o now it's possible to send SysEx dumps stored on SD Card to MIDI devices.

    Preparation: create a directory called "sysex" on your SD Card, thereafter
    create subdirectories for each MIDI Device you want to use.

    For example:
      /sysex/MBSID
      /sysex/MBFM
      /sysex/MicroQ

    Now copy .syx files into these directories which should be sent to the
    devices later.

    Thats all! On your MIDIbox SEQ, change to the MENU->SYSEX menu, the
    devices will be displayed on screen. Select a device to browse through
    the file list. Select a file to send the dump.

    Note: currently .syx files are only sent to the Default port (selected in
    MIDI page). A "store .syx dump" function is planned for later releases.

  o Menu page shows the current sequencer position in measure.step.microstep
    format

  o "About this MIDIbox": separated SD Card Info

  o fixed various minor bugs


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o overworked menu page selection (now uses new list browser)

  o added new info page "About this MIDIbox" (at the end of menu list) to
    simplify support.
    A lot of additional informations are sent to the MIOS Terminal when 
    an item (displayed at left page) is selected with a GP or the SELECT
    button. Use the datawheel or a GP encoder to browse through the list.

    MIOS Terminal is part of MIOS Studio, a command line tool for MacOS 
    available as well.

  o Length 128/256 quick selection won't be displayed anymore if track
    partition doesn't allow this number of steps

  o fixed various minor bugs


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o MBSEQ Parameters are controllable via NRPN messages from external MIDI devices now.
    See also doc/mbseqv4_cc_implementation.txt

  o these parameters can also be controlled via Internal Loopback (Bus1 Port).

  o Loopbacked CC Parameters are print in text format when edited

  o implemented MIDI Remote Keyboard function (note: MBSEQ_HW.V4 has been updated)
    See also doc/mbseqv4_remote_functions.txt

  o fixed various minor bugs


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o if global loop mode enabled, a "*LOOPED*" message will flash at the 
    right corner of the EDIT and STEPVIEW screen.

  o following handling has been added to realize a "smooth startup" for
    people who are in the progress of building their MBSEQ. The core is already
    running, they connect a SD Card but don't have LCDs (so that messages
    cannot be read):
      - if a SD Card without Banks/Songs/Mixer Maps is connected, the appr.
        files won't be created automatically anymore.
      - messages are print on the PATTERN/SONG and MIXER page to inform
        that files have to be created from the UTILITY->DISK menu
      - in the DISK->UTILITY menu you will find a special option at the left
        side which allows to start the formatting process (in fact, the SD
        Card won't be formatted, but some files will be created)
      - there is now a nice progress bar which informs about the state
        so long formatting is in progress

  o CLEAR button has to be pressed for 2 seconds before action is triggered

  o fixed BLM inversion mask configuration


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o Song page got a copy/pase/clear/insert/delete function for song steps.
    Press the SELECT button to select the utility function

  o Copy/Paste/Clear button can be used in song page as well

  o Song/Phrase mode not switched via SONG button anymore (this handling
    is an artifact from MBSEQ V2/V3)
    Instead, the mode can be changed with GP encoder #8 or #9

  o a 16 step selection pattern for the ALL function is now available
    (only selected steps will be touched by the ALL function).
    It can be changed by pressing the SELECT button in EDIT page.

  o the 16 instrument labels of a drum track can be edited now

  o a nice graphical logo is now print during startup

  o lower CPU load if no SD Card connected


MIDIboxSEQ V4.0beta1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial public release.
Short list of changes:
  o uses the new MBHP_CORE_STM32 module (ARM Cortex M3 based derivative)
  o firmware completely rewritten in C - it can be optionally emulated 
    under MacOS
  o patterns/songs/grooves/configs/etc. now stored on SD Card in a FAT32 
    filesystem
  o USB MIDI natively supported, MIDI events are sent more than 100 times 
    faster to a DAW/virtual synth
  o two "common" MIDI IN and MIDI OUT ports, up to 8 additional MIDI OUT 
    ports can be added with MBHP_IIC_MIDI modules
  o track length increased to 256 steps
  o track memory can be partitioned, e.g. 64 steps and 16 parameter layers, 
    or 256 steps and 4 parameter layers. Each track provides 8 trigger layers
  o resolution increased to 384ppqn (16 times faster than common MIDI clock)
  o new MIDI event scheduler concept priorises and sorts queued MIDI events
  o new parameter layer options like "Pitch Wheel", "Roll" and "Probability"
  o special drum mode for easier editing of percusive patterns
  o additional chords (now: 32 in Major/Minor scale)
  o new track progression parameters like "Interval/Repeat/Skip"
  o groove templates can now be customized and stored on SD Card
  o Echo Fx with variable number of repeats, damp, tempo change, note 
    incrementer (can be forced to scale!)
  o LFO Fx with different waveforms, synchronized to track clock, step based 
    selection of period and reset, assignable to Note/Velocity/Length
    + separate CC with definable ppqn resolution
  o value range Limiter Fx
  o Loop Fx (also nice for editing)
  o overworked realtime record function with better quantisation
  o hardware configuration file now read from SD Card. No need to recompile 
    the firmware on changes.


Wishlist for future features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o MIDI File import and export
  o SysEx librarian, recording and dumping function for external Synths or 
    other MIDI gear
  o support for MBHP_ETH module for sending OSC packets without the need 
    for a computer based proxy server
  o finish the remote access function, which allows to control multiple
    instances of MBSEQ (either running on MBHP_CORE_STM32 module or in
    simulation) from a single CS (partly working, can be enabled in the
    OPT menu, but not very user friendly yet)
  o implement BPM LED digit display (as known from V3)
  o implement Tap Tempo function (as known from V3)
  o allow to switch between different sections of a track (A/B/C/D function
    like known from MB808)
  o ALL button should work in mute screen
  o "Preloading steps" as proposed by Gridracer:
     Layer A is already active-> I press it again-> LED goes off or starts 
     blinking. I change the note numbers of the steps without setting them, 
     (audience hears nothing) -> I push Layer A again->  LED is On again. 
     Now I can set the new steps which will now play the intended
     notes right from the beginning.
  o SysEx dump for patterns/songs
  o implementation of a new 16x16 BLM (cascadable to even more buttons/LEDs)
  o now where infos are sent to MIOS terminal, we could also provide a
    console input to control MBSEQ from a terminal (this would even allow
    to create sequences from a computer)
