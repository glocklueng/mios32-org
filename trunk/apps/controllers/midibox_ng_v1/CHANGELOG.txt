MIDIbox NG V1.012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o The application boots a little bit faster now

   o support for more than 2 LCDs.
     A documentation can be found under http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_ng_manual_lcd.html


MIDIbox NG V1.011
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o EVENT_SENDER and EVENT_RECEIVER can now also be assigned to a radio_group.
     This can not only be used in conjunction with BUTTON/LED radio groups, but also
     to distribute MIDI events to from receiver to multiple senders without
     forwarding chains (which then can be used for a different purpose)

   o the "sdcard_format" command allows to format the connected SD Card with FAT32
     from the MIOS Terminal


MIDIbox NG V1.010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o SysEx: added ^cursor, ^txt and ^txt56 identifiers.
     They allow to send messages to the LCD via SysEx.
     A usage example can be found under cfg/templates/logictrl.ngc

   o Labels: ^# allows to terminate a label.
     E.g. "^label^#MyText" prints "MyText" directly after the specified ^label


MIDIbox NG V1.009
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o with a button assigned to 'type=Meta meta=MidiLearn range=0:1' it's now possible
     to activate a MIDI Learn mode which allows to assign an incoming MIDI event to any
     control element

   o with 'type=Meta meta=MidiLearn range=0:2' also NRPN events can be learned (in this case,
     CC#62 and CC#63 will be ignored!)

   o MIDI Learn mode can also be activated in the SCS menu


MIDIbox NG V1.008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o DIN_MATRIX with rows=4 now properly supported

   o DIN_MATRIX/DOUT_MATRIX: it's now possible to invert the rows as well:
     inverted=1 or inverted_sel=1 will invert the selection lines
     inverted_row=1 will invert the row pattern

   o configuration examples for the 16x4 Button/Duo-LED matrix are now
     available under cfg/tests/blm16x4*.ngc


MIDIbox NG V1.007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o changed bank concept: the BANK command has been removed, instead the EVENT
     command got a new "hw_id" and "bank" parameter.
     A simple configuration example can be found under cfg/tests/encbanks.ngc
     More complex configuration examples under cfg/tests/bnk*.ngc

   o added meta=CycleBank (increments bank, resets to 1 if last bank reached)

   o additional new metas: SetBankOfHwId, DecBankOfHwId, IncBankOfHwId, CycleBankOfHwId


MIDIbox NG V1.006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o corrected LED pattern output for the case that the selection lines are inverted.

   o the new SCS command allows to assign emulated button/encoder functions if the SCS
     shows the mainpage.
     A usage example can be found under cfg/templates/lre8x2.ngc


MIDIbox NG V1.005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for value MAPs.
     Various examples can be found under cfg/tests/map*.ngc

   o support for EVENT_CV
     Various examples can be found under cfg/tests/cv*.ngc

   o AINSER modules now disabled after RESET_HW
     They have to be explicitely enabled with the AINSER command

   o the AINSER command now supports the "resolution" and "num_pins" parameters


MIDIbox NG V1.004
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o some minor code cleanup


MIDIbox NG V1.003
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o added "enc_speed_mode" parameter to EVENT_ENC
     Valid modes are Auto (speed automatically adapted according to the value range),
     Slow:0 .. Slow:7 (divides the increments),
     Normal (no special measure) and
     Fast:0 .. Fast:7 (accelerates the increments)
     A configuration example can be found under cfg/tests/encspeed.ngc


MIDIbox NG V1.002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the patterns specified with LED_MATRIX_PATTERN are now reversed so that the
     bit orientation matches with the hardware.

   o reversed value ranges (min value greater than max value) now properly supported

   o support for ain_mode Direct/Snap/Relative/Parallax

   o incoming MIDI values can now trigger the output of EVENT labels if the "fwd_to_lcd"
     option is set to 1 in the related EVENT_* definitions.

   o support for "Radio Groups": button and LEDs can now be assigned to groups, which
     handle the same value over multiple elements.
     A configuration example can be found under: cfg/tests/radiogrp.ngc


MIDIbox NG V1.001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o maximum length of DIN/DOUT shift register chain increased to 32.
     This means that up to 256 digital inputs, and 256 digital outputs are available.

   o Number of virtual button and LED functions increased to 1024

   o New meta event for speeding up ENC movements (EncFast, see .NGC documentation)

   o New meta events for emulating SCS buttons/encoder (see .NGC documentation)

   o Ethernet and OSC setup now stored with ETH/OSC commands in .NGC file

   o SysEx variables are now stored with a SYSEX_VAR command in .NGC file

   o EVENT_BUTTON_MATRIX and EVENT_LED_MATRIX now properly supported
     See cfg/tests/blm8x8.ngc for a simple configuration example


MIDIbox NG V1.000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o initial version
