Each application has to provide a local "mios32_config.h" file, which is included
from mios32.h to configure the code modules.

Main purpose is to allow to disable MIOS32 functions in order to remove unused code.

It also allows to configure the size of data structures (e.g. MIOS32_SRIO_NUM_SR)

Later we could also provide hard-coded variants to increase the flexibility on
unexpected usecases.


Currently, following options are provided. Just copy&paste the relevant lines
into your local mios32_config.h file

// disable code modules
#define MIOS32_DONT_USE_SYS
#define MIOS32_DONT_USE_SRIO
#define MIOS32_DONT_USE_DIN
#define MIOS32_DONT_USE_DOUT
#define MIOS32_DONT_USE_USB
#define MIOS32_DONT_USE_USB_DESC


// number of scanned SR registers on SRIO chain
// default value 16 (see mios32_srio.h)
#define MIOS32_SRIO_NUM_SR 16

// 1 to stay compatible to USB MIDI spec, 0 as workaround for some windows versions...
#define MIOS32_USB_DESC_USE_AC_INTERFACE 1

// allowed number of USB MIDI ports: 1..5
#define MIOS32_USB_DESC_NUM_PORTS 1
